Follow the next steps to use the data acquired with the oscilloscope:
1. Use CommentHeader.sh to format the data files.
2. Use MACRO_DataToTuple.cpp to obtain ROOT files with the data in trees.

It is convenient to use subsets of data for the previous procedure. This is due to the large number of data files that the oscilloscope produces. Hence, both script take too long to process that large number.
